This came after experimenting with <a href=\"https://unity.com/\">Unity</a> and <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/\">Unreal Engine 4</a> for a year or two, but having some frustrations with both of them. Godot had a simple node-based scene system, a custom python-like programming language and of course it was fully free and open source. Something about it just \"clicked\". Although it didn't have all the polish and features of the other bigger-name engines, it was very fun and intuitive to work with.</p>\n<p>The beauty of open source is that if you have a problem (or want a new feature), you can look into the code and try and do it yourself! This is exactly what happened to me - I saw a missing feature, went into the codebase and added it (despite me not really knowing C++ too well). My feature was added to the official release of the engine within a couple of days - and it felt great. So, I decided to chase that feeling.</p>\n<p>Now I have <a href=\"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AEricEzaM+\">over 40 merged bug fixes and feature additions</a>, mostly to do with input handling and the editor - things like graphics rendering and physics are way out of my league. My contributions were recognised by the core development team and I was added as a \"Member\" of the Godot organisation on GitHub.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Godot Game Engine (Contributor)","date":"February 2021","tags":["C++","Open Source"],"url":"https://godotengine.org/","github":"https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AEricEzaM+","headerImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAANCAYAAACpUE5eAAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAADNUlEQVQ4y0WTWW8aVxiG56KVIuWii2S5bZxKVZNWcRLbLDYMywxglgFmGLYJEAPGZt8M2OAY4jROQ5VEaiu1F21uov6G/sKnBydqLl59R+foe+d55ztH2kst8KYv8UVHeOMzjHCLq1yLSX5CIf8cZaeL09FgTxHV08Cj1rC0Gn+PTd7OspQyJQJKjpiWJx6oI3XtLzH1V2iJKwr6OfPiiFJ2STo+IWHOcftbqK4e/r0xitygZWS5Khu8OS5xECkQ0CwU3wFBX42st4KkSSovjCFvqnP6uTMOC1P88TmbcpUfPBnszjqj+II/Kn3eNho8qT6lflAnbZr4w48wi8foD7tkNrqkvOdItRsWRzsVjnxlKsmXpNTXpNxdvvhWZe3rPJbzmJmis3xwm8XWHXKpEVZzgs1tsJ2f4kj8hmtbZ3tNRnePkTJSkuRamsBunaX2jIvoCVN5wJWe5jBaZF5q8VdWxvrkJo8/vUnlnsLeZpL1jSh3tqrc3azik+M0Go/Jl8tIzhub7H4W4UIu8e9xiGU2zsHndRb2DqVgn2mozZ8xhaP1B5hf7nCpKTyLqITX72Pb2GL71ib31/3Efhywb7eE4fdJnN/pRFzHVNUm/UhEDCCMK1kj7n5KcesJqXsZjFsOtG/cnGpBfm1med2wWDzK0VVMjLsZPF+JaQsIyRsb4YkN8Gg9dvdHhIwZEfOMgD5mL9jBpraxBdrY1ZZQmx1/hy0xeUewh1NpEwv3yMcHXIhr5trvIbXHv/PTL/9w+fM7jnqvKDeXFGovyFWeI4f72HxNHMLIIZrtSgtnsIs7PEARzYepIabWxxKGxcSQjhiYFEqdkbDmhNMzcV3GguA9iU0Y7Irm1VevDQXhtjiLJUaUM2ORpk8i2sMrUjwU+z5RD5JDJFlM1aOJV6KN8QlDVT8VOsOfGOMShCua3VD3ms62ktpBiQwwBFEjPWQ/3MElfokS6hDY7yL5kxOCqSmh9DkBY4pqrMwmKMnT/+WJnVwbuoNtZCGPUDrew0qdcJQ9pSiiHorHkRbxpRWBHB3ijnyszkDnQ8z3sn0wy+rCxOiL2qdiDojGemK/QyjSRRfrFeV/r7H4IvkMgzMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=","aspectRatio":1.5873015873015872,"src":"/static/b0757a0b4ecef9c43c568276a48bcda2/bc8e0/headerImage.png","srcSet":"/static/b0757a0b4ecef9c43c568276a48bcda2/8ac63/headerImage.png 200w,\n/static/b0757a0b4ecef9c43c568276a48bcda2/3891b/headerImage.png 400w,\n/static/b0757a0b4ecef9c43c568276a48bcda2/bc8e0/headerImage.png 800w,\n/static/b0757a0b4ecef9c43c568276a48bcda2/6050d/headerImage.png 1200w,\n/static/b0757a0b4ecef9c43c568276a48bcda2/e3efb/headerImage.png 1243w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"godot-game-engine"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1277554887","63159454"]}
