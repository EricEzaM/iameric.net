I figured I could write about some of the programming stuff I do and also have a good place to store pieces of code which I can refer back to in the future. I explored using something like Wordpress but it was my preference to retain full control of the site and to not have to rely on a third-party content management system.</p>\n<p>Initially I thought about using .NET Core and MVC/Razor Pages, but that has the issue of requiring server hosting which would involve some sort of cost and a more complex hosting setup. I then came across <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/\">static site generators</a>, which generate static web pages from a set of template files. There are heaps of options out there like <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a> and <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a>, but I decided to go for <a href=\"http://gatsbyjs.org/\">GatsbyJS</a> since it was based on React (something I wanted to get more familiar with) and I had read a lot of positive things about it. The documentation was also thorough and very easy to read.</p>\n<p>I bought the domain for iameric.net in March 2020, and started building the website. I worked on it on-and-off for quite (it was not live during this time) a while until in late 2020 I committed to working on it a bit more consistently. In early 2021 I finally got the site live.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Personal Website","date":"February 2021","tags":["React","Web"],"url":"https://iameric.net","github":"https://github.com/EricEzaM/iameric.net","headerImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.2988505747126435,"src":"/static/7bed43a53dc5cd1302d545e5c8ffca68/bc8e0/headerImage.png","srcSet":"/static/7bed43a53dc5cd1302d545e5c8ffca68/8ac63/headerImage.png 200w,\n/static/7bed43a53dc5cd1302d545e5c8ffca68/3891b/headerImage.png 400w,\n/static/7bed43a53dc5cd1302d545e5c8ffca68/bc8e0/headerImage.png 800w,\n/static/7bed43a53dc5cd1302d545e5c8ffca68/6050d/headerImage.png 1200w,\n/static/7bed43a53dc5cd1302d545e5c8ffca68/00405/headerImage.png 1600w,\n/static/7bed43a53dc5cd1302d545e5c8ffca68/9c1dc/headerImage.png 1868w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"personal-website"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1277554887","63159454"]}
